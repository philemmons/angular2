- A framework for building client applications in HTML,CSS, and javaScript/TypeScript.
- Gives our applications a clean structure.
- Includes alot of re-usable code. 
- Makes our application more testable.

#### What is TypeScript? 
- By definition, “TypeScript is JavaScript for application-scale development.”
- TypeScript is a strongly typed, object oriented, compiled language.
- It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg (designer of C#) at Microsoft. 
- TypeScript is both a language and a set of tools. 
- TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript compiled to JavaScript. 
- In other words, TypeScript is JavaScript plus some additional features.

#### Difference between TypeScript and JavaScript:

- TypesScript is known as Object oriented programming language whereas JavaScript is a scripting language.
- TypeScript has a feature known as Static typing but JavaScript does not have this feature.
- TypeScript gives support for modules whereas JavaScript does not support modules.
- TypeScript has Interface but JavaScript does not have Interface.
- TypeScript support optional parameter function but JavaScript does not support optional parameter function.

#### Advantages of using TypeScript over JavaScript

- TypeScript always point out the compilation errors at the time of development only. 
    - Because of this at the run-time the chance of getting errors are very less whereas JavaScript is an interpreted language.
- TypeScript has a feature which is strongly-typed or supports static typing. 
    - That means Static typing allows for checking type correctness at compile time. This is not available in JavaScript.
- TypeScript is nothing but JavaScript and some additional features i.e. ES6 features. 
    - It may not be supported in your target browser but TypeScript compiler can compile the .ts files into ES3,ES4 and ES5 also.

#### Disadvantages of using TypeScript over JavaScript

- Generally TypeScript takes time to compile the code.
    - Typescript ==> transpile ==> Javascript
    - TSC: TypeScript Compiler
